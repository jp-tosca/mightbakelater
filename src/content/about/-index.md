I’ve been a hospitality professional for years — wearing many different hats over my career — and always in the front of house. But, truth be told, my heart has always been behind the scenes, in the kitchen. I spend most of my free time baking and cooking for friends and co-workers.  After all the encouragement and nagging from my family and friends — not to mention the newfound free time as a result of the pandemic — finally here I am, sharing my recipes and cooking/baking tips with others and entertaining from afar.
